# ZeldaTimelineGenerator
Application that uses a tree graph generating utility (Portions Copyright Â© 2007 Rotem Sapir)
and user specified attributes to create the closest representation of the data in a graph.

# Plans
For now, it only uses direct connections specified by the user, which require no background
logic beyond building the tree data structure. The next step is to use the exclusion
attributes and the weight of that value to generate separate graphs.

Also I should probably make the output prettier, and may end up replacing the graph lib.

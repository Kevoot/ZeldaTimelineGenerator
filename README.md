# ZeldaTimelineGenerator
Application that uses a tree graph generating utility (Portions Copyright Â© 2007 Rotem Sapir)
and user specified attributes to create the closest representation of the data in a graph.

# Usage
Select the games you want to include in the initial menu from the drop downs. 
For each game, you can define both Direct Connections and Exclusions.

A copy of my LocalData.txt has been included in the root of the directory. The program reads output
JSON files to save locally created data. If you would like to use the one provided (which outputs
the Hyrule Historia timeline), simply drop the LocalData.txt file into the same folder as the 
executable.

# Direct Connections
There are (at the moment) used to define the connection between games. Intended use:
Creating a connection for a game implies that game is the parents, and the specified game
is the target. The Direct Connection attribute is meant as a "strong", direct connection
between two games

# Exclusions
These are functional in the UI, but as of yet have no bearing on the graph generated.
Intended use: These will be used as a modifier to the Tree building algorithm, by calling
into question the linear direction of the games, and allow multiple graphs to be generated 
by each data set.

# Plans
For now, it only uses direct connections specified by the user, which require no background
logic beyond building the tree data structure. The next step is to use the exclusion
attributes and the weight of that value to generate separate graphs.

Beyond that, I'd like to make the enum values importable, so it can be used in a general
sense for whatever movie/TV show/Game/Book that you would like to see "what-ifs?" for.

Also I should probably make the output prettier, and may end up replacing the graph lib.
